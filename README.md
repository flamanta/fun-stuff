Custom classes and functions to speed things up.

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) <!-- omit in toc -->

When I find myself needing to do a task repeatedly (typically in the scale of tens of times), I write custom functions to streamline the process.

But sometimes even custom functions aren't enough, and they are rewritten into custom classes.
